Title:
Interpreter for a Custom Programming Language

Description:
The project involves designing and implementing an interpreter for a custom programming language. The language will feature a subset of basic programming constructs such as variables, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, and functions. The goal is to create an interpreter that can parse and execute code written in this language, demonstrating a deep understanding of language syntax, semantics, and runtime behavior.

Objectives:
1.	Design the Language Syntax and Semantics: Define the syntax rules and semantic behaviors for the custom programming language.
2.	Implement the Interpreter: Develop an interpreter in a chosen language (e.g., Python, C++) that can parse, evaluate, and execute the custom language.
3.	Test Language Features: Create test cases to validate that the interpreter correctly handles all language features.
4.	Document the Language: Provide comprehensive documentation for the language, including syntax, semantics, and example programs.
5.	Demonstrate the Interpreter: Showcase the interpreter's capabilities through a series of example programs and a presentation.

Having reached the middle of my project to create an interpreter for a custom-designed
programming language, I firmly believe that I have made considerable progress toward the
realization of the set objectives.

Syntax and Semantics of Language Design:
I have completed the initial design of syntax and semantics of the language. The language
includes variables, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, and functions. I had defined the
grammar in BNF notation, which helped a lot in formalizing the syntax rules. In the semantic
behaviors, each construct clearly describes how the interpreter should execute that operation.

Semantic Interpreter Implementation:
Python was chosen to implement the interpreter because it is comparatively simple and has
powerful libraries for parsing. So far, I have implemented the lexer and parser parts of it. The
lexer tokenizes the input code, while the parser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree from these
tokens. Further, I implemented the execution logic for variables and arithmetic operations so
that the interpreter could handle assignments and evaluate expressions with variables and
numbers.

Testing Language Features:
Reliability - Test Suite: I have provided a test suit that shall ensure that the features
implemented so far, such as variable declarations, assignments, and arithmetic computations,
work as expected. The tests ensure that the interpreter produces expected results.

Documentation of the Language:
I started the language documentation. It contained a syntax and semantics explanation in detail,
with code snippets that demonstrated the usage basics for variables and arithmetic operations.

Further Steps:
Implement Conditionals and Loops: I will also work to enhance the interpreter to allow for if-else
statements and looping constructs such as while and for.
Function Support: This would involve implementing user-defined functions, handling scope
management, and parameters.
Testing Extension: With more features to be added, I'll write additional test cases for complete
coverage.
Documentation Completion: I continue to enrich this documentation with more and more examples to
explain the new features.
Demonstrations Preparation: Start example programs that will be used later for the final
presentation of the capabilities in the language.

Problems:
The most inconvenient situation is syntactic error handling. That the interpreter did not crash but
gave a sensible error message took special care in parsing.
Generally speaking, I am satisfied with the progress and am in a position to assure that the
objectives of the project will be met at the deadline.
