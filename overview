Having reached the middle of my project to create an interpreter for a custom-designed programming language, I firmly believe that I have made considerable progress toward the realization of the set objectives.
Syntax and Semantics of Language Design:
I have completed the initial design of syntax and semantics of the language. The language includes variables, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, and functions. I had defined the grammar in BNF notation, which helped a lot in formalizing the syntax rules. In the semantic behaviors, each construct clearly describes how the interpreter should execute that operation.
Semantic Interpreter Implementation:
Python was chosen to implement the interpreter because it is comparatively simple and has powerful libraries for parsing. So far, I have implemented the lexer and parser parts of it. The lexer tokenizes the input code, while the parser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree from these tokens. Further, I implemented the execution logic for variables and arithmetic operations so that the interpreter could handle assignments and evaluate expressions with variables and numbers.
Testing Language Features:
Reliability - Test Suite: I have provided a test suit that shall ensure that the features implemented so far, such as variable declarations, assignments, and arithmetic computations, work as expected. The tests ensure that the interpreter produces expected results.
Documentation of the Language:
I started the language documentation. It contained a syntax and semantics explanation in detail, with code snippets that demonstrated the usage basics for variables and arithmetic operations.
Further Steps:
Implement Conditionals and Loops: I will also work to enhance the interpreter to allow for if-else statements and looping constructs such as while and for.
Function Support: This would involve implementing user-defined functions, handling scope management, and parameters.
Testing Extension: With more features to be added, I'll write additional test cases for complete coverage.
.doc Completion: I continue to enrich this documentation with more and more examples to explain the new features.

 Demonstrations Preparation: Start example programs that will be used later for the final presentation of the capabilities in the language.
Problems
The most inconvenient situation is syntactic error handling. That the interpreter did not crash but gave a sensible error message took special care in parsing.
Generally speaking, I am satisfied with the progress and am in a position to assure that the objectives of the project will be met at the deadline.
